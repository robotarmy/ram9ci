 I need an endpoint for github post commit hooks.

 This endpoint needs to do the following
 - checkout code
 - run bundle install --deployment
 - run rake

 I want the endpoint to show the the result
 of the rake task on fail otherwise green screen

 concerns :
  malevolent rake tasks
  killer whales.
